# Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on **customer segmentation** using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis technique. RFM analysis is a data-driven marketing strategy that segments customers based on their purchase behavior. It allows businesses to identify high-value customers, optimize marketing strategies, and improve customer retention.  

## RFM Analysis Explained  
1. **Recency (R)**: How recently a customer made a purchase.  
2. **Frequency (F)**: How often a customer makes a purchase.  
3. **Monetary (M)**: How much money a customer has spent.  

Each metric is scored, and customers are segmented based on their RFM score, enabling targeted marketing campaigns.  

## Tools and Libraries  
- **Language**: Python (alternatively, R can also be used).  
- **Libraries**:  
  - Pandas: For data manipulation.  
  - NumPy: For numerical computations.  
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.  

## Key Steps in the Project  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Clean the dataset (remove nulls, duplicates, and outliers).  
   - Convert date formats if necessary.  

2. **RFM Metrics Calculation**:  
   - Calculate **Recency**: Time difference between the most recent purchase and the analysis date.  
   - Calculate **Frequency**: Total number of transactions per customer.  
   - Calculate **Monetary**: Total transaction amount per customer.  

3. **Scoring and Segmentation**:  
   - Assign scores (e.g., 1-5) for each metric based on quantiles.  
   - Combine scores to create an RFM score (e.g., 555 is the best customer).  

4. **Customer Segmentation**:  
   - Group customers based on RFM scores into segments such as:  
     - **Champions**: High R, F, and M scores.  
     - **Potential Loyalists**: Medium R, high F and M scores.  
     - **At Risk**: Low R, moderate F and M scores.  

5. **Visualization and Insights**:  
   - Use bar charts, heatmaps, or scatter plots to visualize RFM segments.  
   - Derive actionable insights for marketing strategies.  

## Output  
- A segmented customer dataset with RFM scores.  
- Visualizations depicting customer segments and their characteristics.  
- Insights to guide marketing and customer engagement strategies.  

## Benefits of RFM Analysis  
- Identifies high-value customers for rewards or loyalty programs.  
- Helps design personalized marketing campaigns.  
- Improves customer retention by addressing at-risk customers.  

## Future Scope  
- Enhance analysis with additional metrics like customer lifetime value (CLV).  
- Automate RFM analysis and reporting using dashboards (Power BI/Tableau).  
- Integrate machine learning for predictive customer behavior insights.
